					Dear Professor Sansone,
				</p>
				<p>
					As an experienced developer and a long-time admirer of the University of Oxford, I was thrilled to learn of the vacancy for a Web Developer position with the Data Readiness Group at the Oxford e-Research Centre. My current Web Developer capacity tasks me with writing high-quality software and making efficient use of the modern possibilities of software engineering. As this work excites me greatly, I would be elated to join the Data Readiness Group at the Oxford e-Research Centre in the role of a Web Developer and wish to apply for this position formally.
				</p>
				<p>
					I first became acquainted with the Open Science concept during an online lecture at the University of Konstanz in 2021. One of its core principles – to publish as much as possible, as early as possible, and to keep research data FAIR – is particularly interesting to me, given its alignment with the principles of the Open Source movement, of which I am an enthusiast and which itself can be seen as one of the elements of Open Science.<br>
					As a German public service employee, I am encouraged to use open-source software wherever reasonable in addition to publishing my code as part of the Public Money, Public Code initiative. Likewise, I also share the source code of my private projects as open-source using the MIT licence. <br>
					I wish to contribute more intensively to the Open Science movement by designing and developing user-friendly web applications for this community. Working on the continued development of FAIR resources, such as the FAIR Cookbook, allows me the chance to do just that, as providing powerful, state-of-the-art platforms for research data management is vital to the dissemination and acceptance of Open Science. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the past four years, I have been working as a Web Developer for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, where I design and program new web applications for the organisation’s Drupal-based intranet, both frontend and backend. In doing so, I can apply and continuously expand my knowledge of PHP, HTML, and SCSS. As representatives from diverse professional groups use the intranet, I am well-acquainted with taking into account the needs of different stakeholders in each project. My goal is to make the intranet a tool that effectively facilitates the users’ daily work. I am committed, via my coding, to process and present data in such a way that it is easy for users to find or access. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My interest and passion for programming extend into my spare time, where I administer or create new websites and programs using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I continue to educate myself by taking online courses on web programming topics and enjoy it immensely! Currently, I am learning Action Cable - a Rails library for creating performant real-time applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Specific to the job description, I admit that some of the libraries and frameworks outlined, such as Vuetify or Vue.js, are new to me with little or no experience. However, the tasks this position is responsible for fascinate me greatly, I am very motivated and from previous experience I know that I would be able to quickly and thoroughly familiarise myself with new topics and dedicate myself to them with a high level of energy and commitment. <br>
					I see myself as a communicative and collaborative person with a keen ability to work in a structured, organised matter while shifting or prioritising on the fly as needed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As a skilled and dedicated Web Developer, I would bring practical support to the Data Readiness Group at the Oxford e-Research Centre. I am eager to take on new tasks in an exciting, international environment that will challenge me and allow for additional growth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would be glad to share more about my skills and experiences with you and learn more about this position in a personal interview.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,
				</p>
